    <strong>Nobody</strong>’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
    Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody</strong>’’s good at anything at first.<br>
    There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
    And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
    Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
    Slowly. <em>Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.</em><br>
    <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
    Until one day, you walk.<br>
    One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
    Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
    Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
    This. is. learning.<br>
    It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
    <strong>You</strong> just don’t get it, yet.
    Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
    are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
    Whoever <strong>You</strong> are, wherever <strong>You</strong> are.<br>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>You</strong>’ only have to know one thing:<br>
    <strong>You</strong> can learn anything.
