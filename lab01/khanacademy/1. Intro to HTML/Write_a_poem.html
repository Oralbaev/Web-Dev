<h1>Prince from coal capital</h1>
<p>We head south to sniff<br>
    Ocean breeze<br>
    I have already recruited a team of 10 dead souls<br>
    Two of us and 8 hungry wolves<br>
    I will resurrect you from the foam<br>
    To master the matter<br>
    Let's be a gang of these waters and lands<br>
    Coming aboard with my special contraband<br>
    With such and such a body<br>

    Fuck these storms, fuck the north<br>
    Definitely fuck this city, fuck these norms<br>
    Fuck this coast<br>
    Fuck these storms, fuck the north<br>
    Definitely fuck this city, fuck these norms<br>
    Fuck this coast</p>
